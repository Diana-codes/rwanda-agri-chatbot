# Hugging Face Spaces Deployment Instructions

## Step 1: Create Space
1. Go to https://huggingface.co/new-space
2. Choose "Gradio" as SDK
3. Name it "rwanda-agri-bot" (or your preferred name)
4. Set to Public

## Step 2: Upload Files
1. Upload these files to your Space:
   - app.py
   - requirements.txt
   - README_HF_Spaces.md

## Step 3: Upload Model
1. Upload run_balanced.tar.gz to your Space
2. Extract it in the Space (or upload the model files directly)

## Step 4: Deploy
1. The Space will automatically build and deploy
2. Wait for the build to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)
3. Your chatbot will be live at: https://yourusername-rwanda-agri-bot.hf.space

## Step 5: Test
1. Try sample questions:
   - "When should I plant maize in Rwanda Season A?"
   - "What soil is good for growing beans?"
   - "How do I control fall armyworm?"

## Troubleshooting
- If model doesn't load: Check file paths in app.py
- If build fails: Check requirements.txt versions
- If slow: Normal for CPU inference on free tier
